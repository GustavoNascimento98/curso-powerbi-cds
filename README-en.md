## Overview
Olist is a Brazilian company that operates an e-commerce platform connecting small and medium-sized businesses to major marketplaces. They assist these businesses in expanding their online presence and increasing sales by providing an integrated solution that simplifies the sales process across multiple channels. Olist also offers logistics services and support to help sellers efficiently manage their businesses.

In the report's development it was used a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) containing information on 100,000 orders from 2016 to 2018 made on multiple marketplaces in Brazil. Its features allow visualization of an order across various dimensions: from order status, price, payment performance, and shipping to customer location, product attributes, and finally, reviews written by customers. The relationship between the data entities can be verified below:

Due to the high volume of data and the challenge of deriving insights, the business team commissioned a interactive dashboard to assist data-driven decision making.

## Business Problem
With rapid growth and increasing complexity in the business environment, Olist recognized the need to develop a dashboard to facilitate strategic decision-making. The business team faced significant challenges in obtaining actionable insights due to the lack of a comprehensive and centralized view of all operations.

Faced with these challenges, the development of a dashboard became a strategic priority for Olist. A centralized and intuitive dashboard would provide the business team with a panoramic view of operations, enabling more informed and agile decision-making. By providing actionable insights into business operations, user behavior, and key metric performance, the dashboard would empower Olist to drive effective and sustainable growth.


## Final Product
The solution to the business problem is a [report](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNDFhOTNmZTctMDVhYy00ZDYyLWI1ZTMtYTE0YzIyMmFhNmNmIiwidCI6ImRhNmQ0OWRhLTU1N2MtNDQxNy04YWVmLTg4ZTA1MDcxOTE0MyJ9) comprising 6 dashboards that shed light on various aspects of the business:

1. **Product View**: Insights into the characteristics of the products being sold.

2. **Payment View**: Insights into the types of payment methods used.

3. **Order View**: Tracking the evolution of orders placed and comparing them with the established targets.

4. **Reviews View**: Analysis of factors influencing customer reviews.

5. **Sellers View**: Characteristics of sellers within the database, such as location, sales value, etc.

6. **Sales View**: Revenue evolution, cohort analysis, and Pareto analysis.


## Future Enhancements
Potential enhancements for the Power BI report include:

1. **Addition of New Indicators**: Identify and add new key performance indicators (KPIs) that can provide additional insights into the business.

2. **Predictive Analyses**: Develop predictive analysis capabilities to forecast the future performance of the business and anticipate potential challenges or opportunities.
