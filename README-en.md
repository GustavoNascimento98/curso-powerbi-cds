# Power BI Project

This project features a dashboard developed during the **Introduction to Power BI** course provided by [Comunidade DS](https://www.comunidadeds.com/). During its development it was used the dataset of a fictional [e-commerce](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) called **Tudo Aqui**.

## Business Problem
**TUDO AQUI** is a Brazilian e-commerce company that has been experiencing growth. However, up until now, most of its decisions have been made by the management team intuitively, without much analysis and precision. Due to the lack of analyzing indicators, the company has made some wrong decisions that have led to losses.

The report developed using Power BI was designed to provide stakeholders and the management team with insights, business trends, and key metrics that affect the company's performance, aiming to provide a solid and well-founded basis for the leadership to make the best possible decisions.


## Report Content
This report comprises 6 dashboards that shed light on various aspects of the business:

1. **Product View**: Insights into the characteristics of the products being sold.

2. **Payment View**: Insights into the types of payment methods used.

3. **Order View**: Tracking the evolution of orders placed and comparing them with the established targets.

4. **Reviews View**: Analysis of factors influencing customer reviews.

5. **Sellers View**: Characteristics of sellers within the database, such as location, sales value, etc.
